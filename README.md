# GeneticCode
Computational workshop teaching basic Python syntax and data structures as a means of explaining how our own genetic "code" works. The notebook demonstrates how we can computationally follow the central dogma and visualize the amino acid sequence of proteins

By completing this workshop, we expect that students will be able to:
* Understand what a programming language is
* Complete simple arithmetic and indexing operations in Python
* Utilize basic Python pragmatics (loading files, running code)
* Demonstrate some understanding of the roles of DNA, RNA, and proteins in biology
* Explain the ordering of the Central Dogma
